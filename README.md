# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation – Machine Learning Task (Colab)

This project uses **K-Means clustering** to segment mall customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**. It was completed as part of my Machine Learning internship under **Elevvo Pathways**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Segment customers into meaningful groups to help businesses:
- Understand spending behavior
- Target high-value customer segments
- Optimize marketing strategies

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle – Mall Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- Features used:
  - `Annual Income (k$)`
  - `Spending Score (1–100)`

---

## 🧪 Tasks Performed

✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✔ Feature selection and scaling  
✔ Elbow method to find optimal clusters  
✔ K-Means clustering  
✔ 2D visualization of clusters

## ▶️ Run on Google Colab

👉 **Open the notebook here**:  
[🔗 Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19qSBrl9o5Ehty1R7WJ8F-j314U-a4cD0?usp=sharing)

> _Make sure to upload the dataset before running._

---

## 🧠 Bonus Ideas

- Try **DBSCAN** or **Hierarchical Clustering**
- Add features like `Age` or `Gender` for deeper segmentation
- Analyze average spending per segment
